git branching concept
git branch
git branch branchname
git branch cart
switch the branch
git checkout cart
git branch

after writing the code
git add .
git commit -m "cart page added"
git push origin branchname
git push origin cart

now cart branch is pushed to remote
now raised a PR after approval
merge to master branch

various branching commands
git branch
git checkout master

git branch mohit
git checkout mohit
create and checkout both
git checkout -b mohit

git switch master
delete naveen branch local
git branch -D mohit

the difference in cart branch not avaialble in master brannch
git log master..cart
git diff master..cart

how many remote branches avaiable
git branch -r

delete a branch from a remote side also from local
git push -d origin naveen

git clone vs git fork
git clone 
git clone url
is used when new member wants to create the workspace
or get the latest code for the first time
import feature in eclipse

git fork
there is a repoistory at the remote side and this is the user naveen
someone has shared a repository with you
and you want to maintain that you dont want to clone it
but you want to maintian under your project so that
you dont have to go that repository again and again
so you can fork this reposirtoy under your user name github directly
fork is nothing related to local and there is no command for that
clone will happend to the local machine or directory and
fork will happend directly to the github site to the respective user name directly it will be added

git pull vs git fetch
git pull origin master
it will give all the code from the remote side master branch to the local side master branch as
well as it will give the code to the working copy also
so it will do 2 transaction - it will give one copy to the local branch
and one copy to the working copy as well - it will visible in working copy as well

git fetch - fetch is also used to take the object and files from remote side to the local side
when we take the latest fetch it will just create the copy to the local repo side and store in that branch
it will not create any copy to the working copy
so now if you want to move that to working copy so you have to use git merge
git pull = git fetch + git merge

git pull origin master
git fetch
git pull origin master or git rebase

if you want to see after git fetch
git diff master origin/master

git merge vs git rebase
